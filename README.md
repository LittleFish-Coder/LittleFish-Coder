# Hi there! I'm Chen-Yang Yu

## About Me

I am Chen-Yang Yu, currently pursuing my master's degree in AI Robotics at National Cheng Kung University.

**Currently Working On Few Shot Learning on Fake News Detection (GAT, BERT, LLM)**

Research Domain:
- GNN: Graph Neural Network
- Computer Vision: Image Processing, Object Detection
- Language Model: LLM, RAG, MCP
- Software Development: Frontend, Backend, CI/CD

## Internship Experience
**Micron (Jul. 2024 - Aug. 2024) - Data Scientist Intern:**
- Developed a real-time monitoring system to enhance **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** by automating
detection processes
- Designed statistical models using multiple moving averages for **time series anomaly detection**

**TSMC (Jun. 2022 - Jan. 2023) - Software Engineer Intern:**
- Engineered full-stack solutions using **Flutter(frontend)** and **Spring Boot(backend)** with **MongoDB**
- Utilize Azure DevOps pipeline with **Git, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD,** improving development efficiency

## Publications

**[DynGraph-GAT: Adaptive Edge Construction for Content-Based Few-Shot Fake News Detection](https://github.com/LittleFish-Coder/DynGraph-GAT)**

![Accepted at ITAOI 2025](https://img.shields.io/badge/Accepted-ITAOI%202025-green)

DynGraph-GAT is a few-shot fake news detection framework that constructs dynamic semantic graphs from news content, without user data. It combines RoBERTa embeddings and Graph Attention Networks, achieving strong performance in few-shot scenarios.
